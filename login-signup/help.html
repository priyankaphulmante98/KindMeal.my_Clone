        <p>Restaurants create attractive deals within KindMeal, which you can obtain coupons for.
             Our coupons differ from other conventional deal sites in that you do not need to make
              any upfront payment at KindMeal, and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer,
               mobile or laptop without any print coupons. For restaurants that do not require advance 
               reservations, you can even use the LiveCoupon immediately! After all, eating is an
                impulsive decision, right?
        </p>


    </br>

        <h2>How do I get a KindMeal coupon?</h2>
        <p>Just browse to a deal you like, select the corresponding outlet location
             (if the restaurant has multiple locations), then click on Get Coupon. 
             Please note that the outlet location <b>cannot be changed </b>after the coupon is obtained.
        </br>
            Each member is limited to 5 active coupons only. You must use the coupons before you can
             obtain additional ones. Unused coupons will automatically expire upon reaching its due date.

         Please note that not all deals support KindWords - it depends on the merchant.
        </p>

    </br>

        <h2>How do I use my KindMeal LiveCoupon?</h2>
        <p>
            Once a coupon is received, you can access the LiveCoupon and use it via one of the following ways. An Internet 
            connection is required.
          <li>At KindMeal website, under Account -><a href="">My Coupons</a>section</li>
          <li>With our KindMeal mobile app, under Deals -> My Coupons section</li>
          
        </p>

    </br>

        <p>You should only activate the LiveCoupon when you are at the restaurant, and upon informing the merchant.
             Some merchants may require that you activate it during the ordering process, while some will be during
              the payment process. Please inform the merchant first when you are ordering to ensure they are aware
               of your KindMeal LiveCoupon.

            Once an active LiveCoupon is loaded, you will see a timer counting down the time remaining to use it. 
            To activate it, click on Use LiveCoupon. Please ensure that you only activate it upon the request of the merchant.
            <b> Activating it ahead of time may void your coupon and deal.</b>
        </p>

    </br>

        <h2>What if I don't have a mobile device or Internet connection, can I use a Print Coupan?</h2>
        <p>
            This depends on the specific deal. If the merchant allows it, you can also choose to print out the coupon and bring it along. 
            Please refer to the deal's Terms & Conditions to check if print coupons are allowed, and if any prior reservation and usage
             delay are required.
      </br>
            To print your coupon, first access it via KindMeal website at the Account->Account -><a href="">My Coupons</a> section, then click on Print Coupon
           at the corresponding coupon. If the Print Coupon button is not available, it means that only LiveCoupons are accepted for the deal.
        </p>

    </br>

        <h2>what is a Print Coupon's Usage Delay?</h2>
        <p>
            Some merchants may not have the facilities available to verify Print Coupons instantly, so they may impose a Usage Delay 
            of a certain number of days to first print out a cross-checking reference list. If there is a 3-Day delay, it means that 
            you can only use the Print Coupon 3 days after obtaining the coupon.
        </br>
            You may wish to check with the merchant first before using it. We strongly suggest using a LiveCoupon instead, 
             which is immediate with no usage delays.
        </p>
